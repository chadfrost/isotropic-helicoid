# isotropic-helicoid 

Lord Kelvin's hypothesized shape 

First cut at modeling an isotropic helicoid, suitable
for experiments as per Lord Kelvin in 1871, and paper
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.074302 (see 
also article, https://physics.aps.org/articles/v14/s89)

Note, if printed in PLA, must be at least ~80% infill
or it will float in water!

Density of common FDM materials (good table at 
https://omnexus.specialchem.com/polymer-properties/properties/density):
PLA = ~1.25g/cm^3
ABS = 1.0 - 1.05 g/cm^3
PETG = 1.27 - 1.38 g/cm^3
